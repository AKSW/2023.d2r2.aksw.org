Events, company and trade networks are essential in investigating global societal and economic interrelations.
Knowledge graphs can model these facets.
This talk will first give an overview of [EventKG](https://eventkg.l3s.uni-hannover.de/) ‚Äì a multilingual knowledge graph of more than 1 million events in 15 languages.
These events, attributes, and relations enable event analytics and reveal global dependencies.
In addition, this talk introduces the project [ATTENTION!](https://attention-project.eu/) and how it aims at using knowledge graphs to help understand global trade and company networks.
By detecting potential conspicuous patterns, the goal is to protect a company's supply chain and to ensure its brand protection.

## Abstract

In the face of continuously changing contextual conditions and ubiquitous disruptive crisis events, the concept of resilience refers to some of the most urgent, challenging, and interesting issues of nowadays society. 

Recent crises like the Covid-19 pandemic wave and the Russia-Ukraine War have not only tested supply chains and economic value networks to their limits but revealed the need to increase flexibility of technical infrastructures, energy supply, health systems, and social textures alike.
Currently, many economic and social spheres are continuously challenged by recession fear, political ploys, and weather disasters to unfold capacities to withstand as well as refine and transform themselves to stay ahead of changes.

Semantically represented data can play a crucial role in increasing transparency of value chains and  understanding the complex mechanisms of crisis factors on a global level.
The systematic integration, KI-based modeling and analysis of huge amounts of data from various sources can build a new basis for situational awareness and decision making as well as for the elaboration of advanced resilience strategies.

The D2R2‚Äô23 workshop, which is organized by the [CoyPu project](https://coypu.org/), will provide an open forum to exchange current issues, ideas, and trends in the area of Data-driven Resilience Research.
The workshop will bring together scientists, software engineers, resilience practitioners, and domain experts in order to approach the topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective.
Ongoing technological developments, current research approaches as well as use case scenarios, and field reports will be presented and discussed with a broad specialist audience. 

We invite contributions of novel results and ongoing work as well as position papers focusing on various aspects of Data-driven Resilience Research from a scientific or practical perspective.
