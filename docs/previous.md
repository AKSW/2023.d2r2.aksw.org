# Previous Workshop

In 2022 we held the [D2R2’22: International Workshop on Data-driven Resilience Research 2022](https://2022.dataweek.de/en/d2r2-22/) at the [Data Week Leipzig 2022] (https://2022.dataweek.de/en/).
Despite the local focus of the host event, the D2R2’22 workshop has attracted a transregional as well as international audience. From a total of 16 submissions we have 11 accepted for publication, (the proceedings are still in production).
Even the 5 submissions, that were not accepted for publication, were relevant contributions to the discussion of the workshop and were accepted as invited talks.
