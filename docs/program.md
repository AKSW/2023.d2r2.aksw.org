# Program

We have received contributions of novel results, ongoing work, and position papers focusing on various aspects of Data-driven Resilience Research from a scientific or practical perspective.

For the workshop, we received a total of 12 contributions, out of which 7 were selected to be included in the proceedings and for presentation.
Additionally, we are happy to have a keynote at the beginning of our half day workshop.
